# Meal Planner
A project for Hyperskill's Java Backend Developer track.

I have yet to clean this up because the methods save data to both local Collections and an SQL database, with the former being part of earlier stages and being ultimately unnecessary. Also, due to some task constraints, I had to implement some stuff that I knew was suboptimal, such as using INT SQL types when SERIAL would be the best option.

This repo contains only the .java files that I have worked on.
